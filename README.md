# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

I was given the task of building a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. SVG is an XML-based vector image format for defining two-dimensional graphics, having support for interactivity and animation. SVG images are defined in a vector graphics format and stored in XML text files. SVG images can be scaled in size without loss of quality. SVG files can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed.

## Installation

To use this application, be sure to download and install node.js. Specifically, the inquirer package included in node.js is required to run this application. Jest is also required to run the tests that I created for this application.

## Usage

Once you have the required dependencies installed, simply run the index.js file in the terminal and follow the prompts. A file named "logo.svg" will then populate and can be previewed in VS code. My SVG Logo Maker is the perfect way to generate a simple logo for your projects without having to include a graphic designer. SVG supports interactivity, animation, and rich graphical capabilities, making it suitable for both web and print applications.

## Credits

Throughout the making of this project, I frequently referenced my class repository ASU-VIRT-FSF-PT-10-2023-U-LOLC. I also referenced Google, W3Schools, MDN Webdocs, The Full-Stack Blog, Wikipedia, W3.org, and ChatGPT. A sample SVG file made by this application is located in my GitHub repo.

## Tests

I have created Jest tests for my project and each of the tests have passed. The tests can be found in the shapes.test.js file and can be invoked by typing "npm test" in the terminal.
